## What it does

`to-tickets` breaks a plan, spec, or the current conversation into a set of **tickets** — each a tracer-bullet vertical slice — and publishes them as GitHub issues, with every ticket declaring the tickets that block it.

Every ticket is a **tracer bullet** — a thin *vertical* slice that cuts through all integration layers end-to-end (schema, API, UI, tests), never a horizontal slice of one layer. A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own, which is what makes each ticket safe to hand to an agent.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/to-tickets` — the agent won't reach for it on its own.

Reach for it once you have an agreed plan or a written spec and you want it split into tickets. Point it at the conversation, or pass a spec or issue reference and it fetches the body and comments first. If the change hasn't been written up as a spec yet, produce one first — for that, use [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec).

## Prerequisites

A GitHub repo you can reach — the tickets are published as issues on it. It applies the `ready-for-agent` label as it publishes, so if your repo triages under different label strings, [setup-project-home](https://aihero.dev/skills-setup-project-home) needs to have recorded that mapping first.

## The blocking edges are the point

One issue per ticket, published blockers-first so each edge can name a real issue number. Any ticket whose blockers have all landed is on the **frontier** and can be grabbed — which is what lets several agents run at once instead of one queue worked top to bottom.

The edges are recorded as GitHub's **native issue dependencies** where your repo has them, because that renders the frontier visually in GitHub's own UI. Where it doesn't, they become a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of each ticket body — the same information, just without the picture.

`to-tickets` produces the artifact; how you run it — sequentially by hand, or as a parallel fleet — is up to you.

## Vertical slices, not horizontal ones

The whole skill turns on one distinction. A **horizontal** slice ships one layer of the change — all the schema, or all the API — and nothing works until every layer lands. A **vertical** slice, the tracer bullet, ships one narrow path through *every* layer at once, so it can be demoed the moment it's done.

Before slicing, `to-tickets` looks for prefactoring — "make the change easy, then make the easy change" — and orders that work first. It then quizzes you on the breakdown (granularity, blocking edges, what to merge or split) before publishing anything, and publishes blockers first so each ticket's "Blocked by" can reference a real ticket.

## The wide-refactor exception

One shape breaks the tracer-bullet rule: a **wide refactor** — a single mechanical change (rename a column, retype a shared symbol) whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, so one edit breaks thousands of call sites at once and no vertical slice can land green. `to-tickets` slices it as **expand–contract** instead: expand (add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks), migrate (move call sites over in batches sized by blast radius, one ticket per batch, CI green throughout because the old form still exists), then contract (delete the old form once no caller remains). When even the batches can't stay green alone, they share an integration branch that all block a final integrate-and-verify ticket, and green is promised only there.

## Where it fits

`to-tickets` is a step in the main build chain:

```txt
grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement → code-review
```

It sits between [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec), which hands it a settled spec with user stories to slice against, and [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement), which builds each ticket, driving [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) internally to write the tests test-first, before its [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) pass. Work the frontier one ticket per fresh context, clearing between them. When you're unsure which skill or flow fits, [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes you.
